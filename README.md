Multiple domination models for placement of electric
vehicle charging stations in road networks.

Electric vehicles have been developed to reduce carbon emissions. However, their limited
range and the need for frequent recharging presents significant challenges. Strategically
placing charging stations is essential to enhance the usability of Electric Vehicles (EVs). In
this paper, we model the locations of charging stations on the Stellenbosch road network
as a multiple dominations model to ensure that charging stations are accessible from all
locations on the road network. To achieve an optimal solution, we utilize heuristics such
as greedy methods, probabilistic methods and the combined approach that integrates both
methods. We compare our results with other research conducted in Dublin and Boston.
