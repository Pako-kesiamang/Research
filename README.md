## Title  
**Multiple Domination Models for the Placement of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in Road Networks**

##Abstract  

Electric vehicles (EVs) are a promising solution for reducing global carbon emissions. However, challenges related to limited driving range and the availability of charging infrastructure hinder widespread adoption. One key solution is the strategic placement of charging stations to ensure optimal coverage and accessibility.

In this research, we model the **Stellenbosch road network** as a graph and approach the charging station placement problem using **multiple domination models** from graph theory. This ensures that every road segment is adequately "dominated"i.e., close to at least one charging station—according to defined distance constraints.

To find effective placement strategies, we developed and compared three heuristic optimization methods:
- **Greedy algorithm**
- **Probabilistic method**
- **Hybrid approach** (combining both greedy and probabilistic logic)

The performance of each method was evaluated in terms of runtime efficiency, solution cost, and coverage quality. We also compared our results with similar studies conducted on the **Dublin** and **Boston** road networks.

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**  
- **OSMnx** (for geospatial data and road network construction)  
- **NetworkX** (for graph modeling and analysis)  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)  
- **Graph theory, heuristic optimization**

## Key Results  
- Improved runtime by **50%** compared to baseline methods  
- Achieved more cost effective and scalable solutions for EV infrastructure planning
